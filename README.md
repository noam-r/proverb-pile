- **Stateless Puzzle Delivery**: Puzzles loaded via Base64-encoded URL parameters
- **Puzzle Builder**: Create and share your own custom puzzles
- **Multilingual Support**: English and Hebrew with RTL support
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive word rearrangement with keyboard alternatives
- **Cultural Context**: Learn about the origin and meaning of each proverb
- **NYT-Style Minimalist Design**: Clean, accessible interface following WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## üåê Architecture Decisions

### Stateless Design
Puzzles are encoded in the URL using Base64, eliminating the need for a backend database. This makes the game:
- Easy to share (just copy the URL)
- Zero-cost to host (static site on GitHub Pages)
- Privacy-friendly (no data collection)

### Multi-Proverb Gameplay
Original design had 3 sequential stages (one proverb at a time). Changed to single stage with all words mixed together for increased difficulty and engagement.

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle
Words are shuffled using the Fisher-Yates algorithm to ensure true randomization across all proverbs, preventing players from identifying words by their grouping.

## üîß Key Technical Implementations

- **HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API**: Native browser support for word dragging
- **React Hooks**: useState, useCallback, useMemo for optimal performance
- **CSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling preventing conflicts
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
- **React Router v7**: HashRouter for client-side routing on GitHub Pages
- **Base64 Encoding**: Compact puzzle serialization in URLs

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:

1. Push to `master` branch
2. GitHub Actions runs tests
3. If tests pass, builds production bundle
4. Deploys to `gh-pages` branch
5. Available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/proverb-pile`

### Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Follow the TypeScript and ESLint configurations
2. Write tests for new features (see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md))
3. Ensure accessibility standards are met
4. Use Prettier for code formatting
5. Run `npm test` before committing
